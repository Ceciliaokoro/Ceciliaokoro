# Hello, I am Cecilia Okoro! 👋

I have always found data's impact on human and business decision-making intriguing, especially when it comes to questions like "How much of product X did we sell last year?" or "What is the best route to follow to get to my destination on time?" despite having a degree in political science.

Also, I enjoy touring. My physical and emotional health is positively affected by travelling. 
- 🌍 Location: Lagos, Nigeria
- 💼 Current Job: unemployed/aspiring data analyst
- 🌱 I'm currently learning: data analysis
- 🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on mentorship and teaching.
